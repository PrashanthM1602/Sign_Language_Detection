Hereâ€™s your text rewritten with **bullet points** for a clean, professional GitHub format:



**Prerequisites**

* Python **3.9.13** installed on your system.
* Virtual environment (VENV) recommended for dependency management.

**Setup Instructions**

* Navigate to the project directory.
* Create and activate a virtual environment:

  * **Windows:**

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  * **macOS/Linux:**

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
* Install required dependencies:

  ```
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

**How to Run the Application**

* Navigate to the **root directory** of the project.
* Run the application using Streamlit:

  ```
  streamlit run file_name.py
  ```
* Open the link shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
* Grant **microphone** and/or **camera** permissions when prompted.

**Notes**

* Ensure microphone and/or camera are connected before running the app.
* If dependency issues occur, try upgrading pip:

  ```
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
